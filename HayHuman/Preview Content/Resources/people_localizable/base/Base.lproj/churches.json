The dome was originally suspended on the walls but later reinforced by four columns. The facade is crowned with twin bell towers with octagonal domes. Inside are a choir gallery, altar with biblical frescoes, and a 3.5 m marble memorial to the victims of the Armenian Genocide of 1915 in the courtyard.",
